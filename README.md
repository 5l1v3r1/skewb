# Skewb

This is my second attempt at creating an optimal Skewb solver. It runs fairly fast and has found 9 move solutions for me in a short amount of time. It is slower than it could be, because I use neither pruning or threading.

This solver uses the standard move notation, but it takes input in an arbitrary way that I defined.
